# Chat-with-csv-agentic
This project uses Agentic AI, Phidata, Groq, and Streamlit to create an interactive chat interface for querying data from the IMDB Movie dataset (IMDB-Movie-Data.csv). It leverages Groqâ€™s processing power for efficient, natural language queries, enabling users to easily extract insights from large CSV files.
